// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

number = input value
if number % 2 == 0
return true or false

ask for a number
divide the number given by 2
use the modulo operator to find the remainder
if the remainder is 0 number is even and if anything else number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

num1 = userinput1, num2 = userinput2, num3 = userinput3, num4 = userinput4, num5 = userinput5

average = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)/5
add all the numbers into a list
sort the list
minimum = first number in list
maximum = last number in list

The average of the 5 numbers given is + average + .The smallest number out of all numbers is + minimum + and largest number is + maximum +.
